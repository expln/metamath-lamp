### [DEV Version](https://expln.github.io/lamp/dev/index.html)
* Sort assertions on the Explorer tab. https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp/issues/235
### Version 29
* Add "Depends on" filter to the Explorer tab. 
This filter allows to quickly find all assertions which depend (directly and transitively) on the given assertion.
### Version 28
* Support label mode in comments (labels and URLs are clickable in comments).
* Partially support math mode in comments 
(additional styling is applied to symbols in math mode in comments, 
but typesetting is not supported).
* Usability improvement: add some styling to tabs to make it easier to switch between tabs.
### Version 27
* Multiple editor tabs. https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp/issues/153
* Bug fix: Search by description produces misleading results. https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp/issues/215
* Updates in the macros API.
* Updates in the "set.mm example macros" collection of macros.
* Improve usability of the assertion search dialog in the editor.
* Update the ["inline proof"](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v27/editor/inline_theorems.md) 
feature: instead of inlining the theorem for a single step, it is now possible to inline multiple theorems
(and all steps using those theorems) at once.
* A new feature ["Reorder steps"](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v27/editor/reorder_steps_automatically.md).
It automatically reorders steps taking into account dependencies between them.
* Possibility to reorder [bookmarked steps](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v27/editor/bookmark_steps.md)
when only bookmarked steps are displayed.
* Slight changes in the formatting of the completed proof.
### Version 26
* Enable automatic substitution search to minimize presses of the "Find Substitution" button.
* Add "Show unproved only" and "Expand all sources" buttons to the Proof Tree dialog.
* Bug fix: scrolling position changes "randomly" when switching between tabs.
* Allow selecting multiple steps in the editor by holding the Shift key.
* Add the option to include all hypotheses (even unused ones) in the compressed proof.
* Add the "Apply a substitution to all steps" button to the fragment selection actions.
* Add an additional pagination UI element at the bottom of the Explorer page.
* Make it possible to change default parameter values for the bottom-up prover.
* Fix a bug in "Find substitution by unification".
* Add a "Restore default settings" button to the Settings tab.
### Version 25
* Bug fix: Use spaces instead of commas to separate variables in the disjoints section of the editor.
https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp/issues/199
* Extend the [pattern search functionality](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v26/explorer/search_by_pattern.md):
match assertions and hypotheses simultaneously; match assertion and hypotheses separately;
  adjacent symbols (https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp/issues/57); exact match.
* Allow [opening a new Explorer tab](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v26/explorer/multiple_explorer_tabs.md)
with empty search filters.
* Add possibility to [bookmark steps in the Editor](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v26/editor/bookmark_steps.md). 
This allows to show only bookmarked steps.
* Add pagination in the Editor to simplify work with long proofs. Number of steps per page is configurable in the "View options" menu.
* Add a new [transform "Extract: X â‡’ ( ph -> X )"](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v26/editor/transform_extract_for_deduction.md) 
which extracts a part of a step in a deduction proof.
* Add possibility to "[Delete unrelated steps and hypotheses](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v26/editor/delete_unrelated_steps.md)" in the Editor.
* Allow [specifying steps for the "Allowed statements: first level"](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v26/editor/steps_in_bottom_up_prover.md)
option of the bottom-up prover by selecting steps in the editor before invoking the bottom-up prover dialog.
* Implement the "[Inline proof](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v26/editor/inline_proof.md)" in the editor.
* Make it possible to [move all selected steps](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v26/editor/move_multiple_steps.md)
to the top or bottom in the Editor.
* Make it possible to [add assertions from the Explorer tab to the Editor](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp-docs/blob/master/mm_lamp_versions/v26/explorer/add_assertions_to_editor_from_explorer.md). 
This is an equivalent of using the Search button in the Editor, but more handy in some cases.
* Add filtering by description in the Explorer. https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp/issues/178
* Bug fix: An assertion tab crashes if the assertion proof contains errors. https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp/issues/184
* Bug fix: Renumber fails if the goal label is a number. https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp/issues/207
* Implement pagination in the Proof Explorer.
* Add "About this application" button on the Settings tab. https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp/issues/72
* In the bottom-up prover dialog, add possibility to set "Allowed statements: other levels" equal to "Allowed statements: first level".
* Change the default value of "Allowed statements: first level" to None in the bottom-up prover dialog.
* Changes in the API of the Fragment Transform feature.
* Make it possible to run a macro from the UI.
* Migrate to ReScript 11. No functional changes.
